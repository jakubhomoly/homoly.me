## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jakub! I'm a full-stack software engineer, currently working for a startup in MalmÃ¶ called [Swiftcourt](https://swiftcourt.com).

I solve problems for living, mostly related to web-services and mobile apps. I enjoy challenges, learning new things, improving teams and sharing my knowledge with others.

I love reading, discussing the news and political developments, playing board games, going to the gym and developing my own skills every day.

If you'd like to connect on LinkedIn and/or grab a coffee in MalmÃ¶ or Copenhagen, you can find my profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakubhomoly/).
